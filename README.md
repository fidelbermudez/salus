## Milestone 2:

Summary of Progress:

Nicole Romero Ospina: Created the skeleton for the front-end using React.js and dockerized front end. Additionally, created a rough draft of the database relationships.
Fidel Bermudez Jr: Worked with Johnny to create a mock-up of the web application using Figma. Specifically worked on the creation of the welcome screen, the login-in/sign-up page, and the summary/overview page, making sure to highlight the primary features of each page and their usability.
Israel Briones Jr: Researched the various functions that the API Plaid has available to be used so that the group is able to implement the API seamlessly in order to make Salusâ€™s features work as intended and where it can connect to the front-end/back-end.
Kelvin Bueno: Set up backend and database and dockerized app
Johnny Cortez: Created Mockups of features from Milestone 1 on Figma. Specifically, designed the initial mockups of tracker, budget, and bill alert pages. Went into depth of the functionality of each page and how users will interact with them.
