Summary of Progress:

- Fidel Bermudez Jr: Worked with Johnny to create a mock-up of the web application using Figma. Specifically worked on the creation of the welcome screen, the login-in/sign-up page, and the summary/overview page, making sure to highlight the primary features of each page and their usability.
- Israel Briones Jr: Researched the various functions that the API Plaid has available to be used so that the group is able to implement the API seamlessly in order to make Salusâ€™s features work as intended and where it can connect to the front-end/back-end.
