                            At the top left of the page, you will see a button that says <strong>CSV Templates</strong>, click on it to download a zip file containing two CSV files, one that has the headers needed for uploading expenses and the other with the headers needed for uploading your income. <strong>Note</strong>: If you already downloaded your expenses and/or income in a CSV file, just make sure you have the same headers as the templates provided.

                        <li>
